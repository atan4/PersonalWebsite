    <h2>The Challenge:</h2>
    <p class="description">
    At ID Hacks 2016, my team designed an app under 15 hours to better integrate refugee aid organizations into a single system to streamline the processing for aid.<br><br>

    <h2>The Concept:</h2> 
     <p class="description">
    In response to the increasing numbers of Syrian refugees in Lesbos, Greece, we designed a means for refugees to communicate their needs and questions in an unfamiliar country. Coordinaid facilitates efficient, coordinated responses from aid organizations using 2-pronged system (SMS + Website) to reduce miscommunication and optimize for aiding the most refugees between organizations.

<br><br> 
    
    <h2>The Process:</h2> 
    <p class="description">
    At the start of the hackathon, we brainstormed the current problems that refugees and refugee organizations run into:
           
        <ul class="descriptionbullets">
            <li>464 aid organizations lead to overcrowding of aid support</li>
            <li>Inefficiencies in distributing support and resources</li>
            <li>Issues with distinguishing emergency responses from durable solutions (local integration and resettlement)</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>

    <div id="imageprocess">
          <img id="sketch1" src="./img/coordinaidworkflow.png">
    </div>
    <br>
          
    <h2>The Icon:</h2>
    <p class="description">
    The first symbol that comes to mind when thinking about aid is the classically used plus sign. We wanted to think about how aid comes across in many different forms, but Coordinaid is able to package emergency aid and aid for long term adjusments all in its own application. After a few iterations, I settled upon a 3D box with the aid symbol on its side.
    </p>

    </div>
   
    <h2>The Prototype:</h2>
          <p class="description">
          Due to my team running short on time, we briefly drafted a basic prototype for what Coordinaid's website application would look like and how it would operate. Once an account is created, refugee organizations can answer SMS texts sent in by refugees through a basic response or emergency aid depending on the situation. To streamline aid, organizations would also be able to search keywords to allow for more efficient distribution of resources.
          </p>

          <img class="iconprototype" src="./img/keyword.jpg">
    </div>
   
    <h2>Final Thoughts:</h2>
          <p class="description">
          If we were to continue this hack, Coordinaid would eventually incorporate machine learning to answer similar questions asked by refugees. In terms of UX design, we would interview refugee organizations to improve functionality.<br>
